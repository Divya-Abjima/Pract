        <li>Upstream</li>

        <li>On earth we're briefly gorgeous</li>
        - by Ocean Voung
        <p><i>On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous</i> is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. 
        At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. 
        Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, <i> Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous</i> is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.</p>
