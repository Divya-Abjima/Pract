<p>Thank you for choosing CVR for your lymphedema therapy services.
The following policy has been established to provide efficient quality care.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Please call 24 hours</strong> in advance if you need to cancel or re-schedule your appointment. To cancel or reschedule call the Call Center at <strong>(855)-538-8346</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Please arrive 15 minutes prior to your appointment.</strong>> This will allow enough time for you to change into a gown so that the therapist can begin treatment immediately. If you are late, your therapist may need to cancel or re-schedule your appointment</li>
    <li><strong>Please silence or turn off your cell phones during treatment sessions.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Family members</strong>> will only be allowed in treatment rooms when requested by therapist for training. This will eliminate distraction and maintain the privacy of other patients who are receiving treatment. Please try to make provisions for care of young children during treatment</li>
    <li><strong>Therapy will be discontinued if you do not show to 2, or cancel more than 4 follow up appointments.</strong> In order for therapy to be effective, you must come as scheduled unless there are unusual circumstances that prevent you from attending. If you wish to resume therapy, you will need a new prescription from your doctor and will be rescheduled as therapist availability allows.</li>
    <li><strong>Compression bandaging</strong>> must be worn as long as possible. If you are unable to keep bandages on until your next visit, therapy will not be effective. Your therapist will train you and your family to bandage your legs so that you may remove them to bathe. In meantime, “bird baths” may be the best option. However, if you experience any precautions (increased pain, decrease circulation, increased swelling, increased redness, skin irritation) immediately remove bandages and seek medical attention as needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Notify therapist</strong> of any new medical conditions/concerns you may have during treatment.</li>
    <li><strong>Wear appropriate clothing.</strong> The compression bandages are bulky, so wear loose fitting pants and appropriate footwear. If you do not own footwear that will fit over bandages, Velcro surgical shoes may be found at a drug store or online.</li>
    <li><strong>If you insurance coverage changes</strong> during treatment, please notify an office administrator as soon as possible. Your new benefits will need to be verified prior to your appointment.</li>
</ol>
I have read and reviewed the above policy and have informed my therapist of any condition that would limit my ability to be treated for lymphedema. <hr style="color:gainsboro;margin-left:1mm;margin-right:1mm;">
